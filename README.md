# Launch-Box_Yaba_Sanshiro_Fullscreen_AutoHotKey_Script

Made this script as the `Yaba Sanshiro` emulator does not launch in fullscreen mode correctly via comandline flags. So when using this script it will autopress `Alt+Enter` when launching `Yaba Sanshiro` to open in fullscreen.

## Setup

Within `LaunchBox` go to `Tools > Manage Emulators` and double click on your `Yaba Sanshiro` emulator. Open the `Running AutoHotKey Script` Tab and paste in the contents of `launchbox_autohotkeyscript.ahk` into the window (as show in the figure below).

`note` for this to work the `start in fullscreen` option needs to be disabled. Located in `Yaba Sanshiro - File > Settings > Video`.
